# Chatroom

This is a basic chatroom application I built to experiment with web sockets.

## Local setup

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

Create the database

```
psql -f database/schema.sql
```

Run the WebSocket and React dev server

```
npm start
```

Open the website http://localhost:3000/ and start chatting
